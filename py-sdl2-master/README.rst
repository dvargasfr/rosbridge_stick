About PySDL2
============
PySDL2 is a wrapper around the SDL2 library and as such similar to the
discontinued PySDL project. In contrast to PySDL, it has no licensing
restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes instead.

Installation
============
PySDL2 is easy to install and integrate within your own projects. Just
follow Python's standard procedure of installing packages or look for a
prebuilt package for your operating system or distribution.

Documentation
=============
If you just started with SDL and PySDL2, it is strongly recommended
that you read through the tutorial of the documentation to learn the
basics. You can find the documentation at *doc/html* or online at
http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org.
